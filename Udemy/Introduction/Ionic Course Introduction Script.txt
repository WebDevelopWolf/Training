Hi, I'm Liane Stevenson and I run the freelance development agency Web Develop Wolf and I have over fifteen years industry experience in web-based development. I'm here to show you how to make a mobile application from scratch using Ionic and C#. Have you ever had an idea for a mobile application that you think you can make money from? Maybe you own a local business and want to build a tool to make booking or purchasing easier for your customers? Or maybe you want to build a companion app to an existing piece of software or game? Come with me and follow in the footsteps of great mobile application studios and take your concept to the next level with this course. I'm going to show you how to, not only how to design your application but how to make it work practically using live data from a Web 2.0 API and SQL database. So by the end you'll have a fully functioning application taylored to iOS, Andriod and Windows. 

I'll take you through each stage step-by-step in a very generic format so you're free to build my application as a test run or dive straight and bring your idea to the table. So hitch up your backpack and join me as we take a journey from concept to fully-fledged application, you never know you might surprise yourself.
